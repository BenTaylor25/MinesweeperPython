# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a logic game based on a grid.  
The grid has several mines that you don't want to step on.  
Non-mine tiles indicate the number of mines adjacent to them.  
The exact win condition varies by version. In this version you must flag all mines, and step on all non-mines.

The size of the grid and the number of mines can be changed from the settings.

## Controls

The controls for this version are inspired by Vim with `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` for movement.
However arrow keys, and `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` can also be used.

Flag a tile with `f` (for flag), or `m` (for mine).

Uncover a tile with `u` (for uncover) or `e` (convenient key for `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` movement).
